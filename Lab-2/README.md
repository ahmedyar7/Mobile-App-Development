# Lab 2

This folder contain the source of the Lab 2 of Mobile Application development, this includes concepts like

1. Introduction to Dart Programming Language
2. Error and Exception handling
3. Introduction to the Asynchronouse Programming in Dart

## 1. Simple To-Do List App

A command-line application that allows users to manage a to-do list. The program enables users to:

- Add new tasks.
- View all tasks.
- Remove tasks by index with input validation.

### Usage:

Run the program and follow the menu options to add, view, or remove tasks.

## 2. Asynchronous Dart Program with API Simulation

This program simulates fetching data from an API using Dart's `Future` and `async/await` concepts. Features include:

- A function that fetches weather data with a simulated delay.
- Random success or failure responses to mimic real API behavior.
- Proper error handling using `try-catch`.

### Usage:

Run the program to fetch weather data and observe success or failure messages.

## 3. Null Safety and Exception Handling Program

A Dart application that prompts users to enter their age while demonstrating:

- Dartâ€™s null safety features.
- Exception handling when converting user input to an integer.
- A message indicating how many years remain until the user turns 100.

### Usage:

Run the program and input different values (valid ages, empty inputs, or non-numeric values) to test exception handling.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Dart installed, and you are in Lab-2 folder, then use the following command to run any of the programs:

```
dart <filename>.dart
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Replace the <filename> with Task1.dart for Todo-Application
> Task2.dart for Asynchronous Dart Program with API Simulation
> Task3.dart for Null Safety and Exception Handling Program
